          In contrast to the inequality persistent in society today, squid game
          depicts an environment where there is seemingly no inequality among
          its players. Everyone is subjected to the same conditions and no
          player receives special treatment. In terms of food, players queue up
          in an orderly fashion to collect a single portion of the same type of
          food. As for their attire, all players don identical green tracksuits
          which display their respective numbers. Even their sleeping conditions
          are the same, with each player occupying a single mattress on the
          metal bunk beds.

          Therefore, all players in squid game are seemingly portrayed as
          equals, where the influence of money, power and other attributes hold
          no significance in providing them with advantages over other players.
          However, it was revealed that one player had been receiving insider
          information regarding the games that they were subjected to.

        One of the henchmen was found to have been providing information to a
        player regarding the upcoming game that players were going to play in
        the next round. The main conductor of the game, known as the “front man”
        and dressed in black, found out about this and executed the henchmen.

        Players were duly informed about the cheating that was going on and were
        reminded that in squid game, everyone is meant to be equals and cheating
        was strictly prohibited.

          Squid game made an attempt to create an environment where there was no
          inequality between its players. The fact that a hypothetical game had
          to be used to shed light on the harsh realities of today and to
          propose an alternative, that inequality could be minimized- if not
          completely eradicated, is testament to the many implications brought
          about by inequality in our society today. The games go to show just
          how enmeshed inequality is in our society that we have now accepted it
          to be part and parcel of the norm.
