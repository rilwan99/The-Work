        <h3 className="sub-header">The desire for money</h3>
        <p className="body-text">
          Squid game accurately depicts how money has the ability to blind
          individuals and its strong influence on their decision-making. Upon
          visual of the cash prize, there was a considerable number of players
          who still voted to continue playing the game, even at the cost of
          losing their lives. This reinforces that their greed for money
          surpassed their own safety and livelihood
        </p>
        <p className="body-text">
          As a result of capitalism, the role of money today is no longer bound
          to the purchase of necessities or securing a means of living. Money
          has evolved to become an embodiment of one’s social standing in
          society. Therefore, winning the prize money does not only entail a
          life without financial difficulty, but one that is full of other
          privileges and opportunities, in the unequal society today.

        <h3 className="sub-header">Moral conflicts in the pursuit of wealth</h3>
        <p className="body-text">
          In the pursuit of material wealth, individuals frequently encounter
          moral conflicts, and there could be instances where one’s greed for
          money may outweigh his/her morals and values. If an individual is of
          low moral standing, or is in a desperate situation, he/she may be
          inclined to seek wealth, even with the knowledge that their actions
          may result in considerable repercussions for others. Although an
          individual may have to engage in unethical actions in order to gain
          money, they are not deterred in compromising their morals to do so, as
          they are blinded by their greed.

        Despite being one step away from the winning the final prize, the
        protagonist returns back to the side of his childhood friend. He
        subsequently indicates his interest to leave the game, so that the life
        of his friend will be spared and they can return back home together.

          Individuals can overcome their greed for wealth
        </h3>
        <p className="body-text">
          Although inequality persists in society and the greed for money can
          blind individuals in compromising their morals, squid game brings
          across the point that individuals can still stick to their intrinsic
          desire to do good and abide by their morals. Striving to inculcate
          positive changes in society should be the goal of individuals who have
          the means and resources to do so. This is embodied by the protagonist
          as in the final scene of the series, he vows to try his best to stop
          squid games from happening again. Hence, vulnerable individuals would
          not be losing their lives at the expense of the entertainment for the
          rich and powerful.
